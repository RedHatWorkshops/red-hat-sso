# LAB 07 - JavaScript App using Red Hat SSO

## NOTES
1. The source code for the keycloak quick start is [here](https://github.com/redhat-developer/redhat-sso-quickstarts/tree/7.1.x/app-jee-html5). 
2. Be careful when downloading the keycloak.json:
    * make sure you place it in your `../redhat-sso-quickstarts/app-jee-html5`
    * build & deploy in your `../redhat-sso-quickstarts/app-jee-html5` app root with Maven, instead of at the `../redhat-sso-quickstarts` root.
